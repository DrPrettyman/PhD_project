PhD project of Joshua Prettyman

This project involves the application of established Early Warning Signal detection techniques
to time series of dynamical system varibles containing tipping points, and an investigation of 
the pros and cons of a novel technique which uses the changing shape of the power spectrum close 
to a tipping point.
